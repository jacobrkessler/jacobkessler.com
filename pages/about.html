			<h3>For the last 10 years I have been working in the publishing industry. Although it has been a highly rewarding job and has taught me much, I am ready for a change. For years I have floundered on what I really want to be doing with my life. The one consistent theme has always been <q>something with computer</q>. Obviously <q>something with computers</q> is a pretty wide net,  realizing this I have had a somewhat difficult time deciding what I want to do in the world of computers. It seems fitting that the person who brought me to publishing is also the one bringing me to the world of coding, something I always felt would be impossible to actually learn. As i forge ahead one foot in front of the other I can rest assured in the fact that I have a great mentor in Andrew Landry.</h3>
